- 👋 Hi, I’m @AIiceR
- 👀 I’m interested in CSS and SCSS, simple design and accessibility in web design
- 🌱 I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate with anyone who also wants to address the lack of a pretzel emoji on github

Here is a picture of my cat, Beauregard. He's a funny guy with a funny eye and zero (0) teeth.
